## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
We have two parts to the project. In part 1 of the project, we are tasked to identify which individual will click on an ad, use supervised learning algorithm to predict if an individual will click on the ad. Our target variable is clicked.on.Ad,we are given the age,gender,time they spent on the site,internet usage,timestamp which we separated to month,day,hour,min and sec.We dropped year column, had onlyy one year,2016.
In part 2, we analyse online shop website to study customer behaviour, use unsupervised learning algorithm to classify if the customer earned the shop revenue or not. Our target variable is Revenue. The dataset has 12330 rows and 18 columns. The dataset had 14 missing values in the first 8 columns and 159 duplicates, we dropped miising values and duplicates. 
In our experimental design,we did the following

Part 1

Load our dataset and preview Exploratory analysis.

Data cleaning, check for missing data, outliers ,duplicates and deal with them

Univariate analysis

Bivariate analysis Multivariate analysis.

KNN

SVM

Naive Bayes

Decision Trees.

Challenging our solution using random forest.


Conclusion and Recommendation

Follow up questions
